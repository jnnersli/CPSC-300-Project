		<p>The purpose of the table below is to give judges a guideline for scoring a debate and to help maintain consistency between judges. Please note that the level of tournament being judged (whether regional or provincial) should have an effect on the scoring percentages given.</p>

	<div class="table">
		<div class="title">Score (/100)</div>
		<div class="title">Description</div>
		<div class="title">Regional<br>Score %</div>
		<div class="title">Provincial<br>Score %</div>

		<div class="score">> 95</div>
		<div>A debater receiving this score would be perfect and the best debater in Canada. This score would virtually never be given and could only be given with the permission of the Tournament Organizer.</div>
		<div class="score">0.1</div>
		<div class="score">0.1</div>

		<div class="score">92 - 95<br>Excellent</div>
		<div>Scores in this range are for the best debaters in a tournament; those with exceptional skills beyond what you have seen from other students. Speeches in this range should all be articulate, learned, eloquent, and captivating.</div>
		<div class="score">4.9</div>
		<div class="score">9.9</div>

		<div class="score">88 - 91<br>Good</div>
		<div>Debaters in this range are likely some of the better debaters in the tournament. They definitely take control of the debate, and their arguments, rebuttal and questioning skills combine to build a convincing case. They are able to convey their ideas in an interesting, well-proven, and engaging manner and are able to clash directly and specifically with their opponents' points. Debaters in this range may not be the top students in the tournament but will be in the running for awards.</div>
		<div class="score">20</div>
		<div class="score">25</div>

		<div class="score">83 - 87<br>Average</div>
		<div>An average debater, one who is able to provide the expected arguments and speak well. A student at this level may be beginning to formulate persuasive arguments, and should show some insight into the topic. They clash adequately with the opposing team and are able to rebut most of the opponents' points.</div>
		<div class="score">35</div>
		<div class="score">35</div>

		<div class="score">79 - 82<br>Weak</div>
		<div>Students in this range are beginning to learn debating skills and may be good public speakers or good at arguing but perhaps not both. They understand the format but are unable to provide clash for the other team, and may use repetition as a form of rebuttal. These are slightly below-average debaters.</div>
		<div class="score">30</div>
		<div class="score">25</div>
			
		<div class="score">75 - 78<br>Poor</div>
		<div>This range reflects a debater who is having difficulties with the topic, rules and/or format. They may be very hesitant speakers, asking few if any questions, and providing few if any rebuttal points. However, they are trying and may improve as they gain experience.</div>
		<div class="score">9.9</div>
		<div class="score">4.9</div>
			
		<div class="score">< 75<br>Inadequate</div>
		<div>Scores in this range are for debaters who are the worst in the tournament, either becasue they say very, very little, are completely unfamiliar with the rules and/or format, or are purposely offensive. This score would rarely be given and could only be given with the permission of the Tournament Organizer.</div>
		<div class="score">0.1</div>
		<div class="score">0.1</div>
